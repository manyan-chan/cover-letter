# My LaTeX Cover Letter Template

This repository contains the LaTeX source code for my professional cover letter template. It utilizes GitHub Actions to automatically compile the `.tex` file into a PDF document whenever changes are pushed to the `main` branch.

[![Compile Cover Letter PDF](https://github.com/manyan-chan/cover-letter/actions/workflows/compile-cover-letter.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/manyan-chan/cover-letter/actions/workflows/compile-cover-letter.yml)

## Features

*   **LaTeX Source:** The cover letter is written in LaTeX for consistent, professional formatting and easy version control.
*   **Automated Builds:** A GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/compile-cover-letter.yml`) automatically compiles `cover_letter.tex` using `pdflatex`.
*   **PDF Artifacts:** The compiled `cover_letter.pdf` is uploaded as a workflow artifact, making the latest compiled version easily accessible.


## How to Get the Latest PDF

The compiled PDF is not stored directly in the repository but is generated by the GitHub Action. To download the latest compiled version:

1.  Navigate to the **Actions** tab of this repository.
2.  Click on the latest successful workflow run listed under "Compile Cover Letter PDF" (usually the top one).
3.  On the summary page for that run, scroll down to the **Artifacts** section.
4.  You should see an artifact named `Cover_Letter_PDF`. Click on it to download a `.zip` file.
5.  Unzip the downloaded file to find the `cover_letter.pdf`.

## Modifying the Cover Letter

1.  Clone this repository to your local machine.
2.  Edit the `cover_letter.tex` file using your preferred LaTeX editor, filling in the placeholders `[like this]` with the specific details for the job application.
3.  Commit your changes (you might do this locally or on a separate branch if applying for multiple jobs).
4.  If you want the *automated* build for a specific version, push the changes to the `main` branch on GitHub (or whichever branch the Action is configured to watch).
5.  The GitHub Action will automatically trigger, compile the new version, and make the updated PDF available as an artifact (see instructions above).

## Technology

*   **LaTeX:** Document preparation system.
*   **pdflatex:** Specific LaTeX engine used for compilation.
*   **GitHub Actions:** Automation platform for CI/CD.
*   **xu-cheng/latex-action@v3:** The specific GitHub Action used for LaTeX compilation.
